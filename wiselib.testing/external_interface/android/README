There is a Android port available at another project---cbox:
  * https://github.com/CEID-DS/cbox/tree/master/android_wiselib

Documentation is also available:
  * https://github.com/CEID-DS/cbox/wiki/Android-wiselib

The code is---as the Wiselib---under LGPL. We plan to integrate it
directly soon. Until then, however, the code can be taken from the
given source.
