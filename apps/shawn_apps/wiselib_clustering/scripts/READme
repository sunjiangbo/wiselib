all Script files are to be moved to the shawn/buildfiles/ folder
an execution is started using the run.sh script
ie ./run.sh start_parameter end_parameter step_parameter topologies_folder_name algorithm_name
topologies have to be placed under shawn/buildfiles/topologies/
after the execution results are placed to the shawn/buildfiles/data folder
and plots generated to the shawn/buildfiles/plots
also a pdf report with all results is generated in shawn/buildfiles folder

** Debug defines have to be uncommented to get the actual data **

For mmoca algorithm no plots and report generating scripts exist
